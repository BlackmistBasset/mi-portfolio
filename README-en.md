#  Project Portfolio
Welcome! This is my very first project as a Front-end developer: My own Portfolio! :smile:

This was the end-of-module project for the HTML and CSS sections in "Fundacion Ada"'s front-end course. By now it's just an introductory page, but I will be adding new projects along the path. 

The portfolio is entirely designed in HTML and CSS and is responsive for mobile devices starting at 300px width.

We were asked to replicate this design: https://frontend-proyecto-portfolio.adaitw.org/

These are the fonts I chose for my page:

*  **Candal**, for the section titles
* **Fredoka One**, for my name in the intro
* **Karla**, for paragraphs and descriptions

I created the color palette based on the intro image in tones that I liked for this project:
* **Puple**: #68317F
* **Fuchsia**: #B3018A
* **Lilac**: #f2f1f9

**These are my Porftolio sections:**


## Intro
![Screen Presentacion](/Images/intro.JPG)

For this section I searched an image that I felt it represented me. I chose this one as I love forests and nature.

## Habilities
![Screen Conocimientos](/Images/conocimientos.JPG)

This section is about the languajes and resources I will be able to manage after this course.

## Quote
![Screen Cita](/Images/cita.JPG)

This section wasn't an easy one. I chose this quote because I believe that keeping others in mind is very important and has to be a priority for everyone in our lives.

## Projects
![Screen Proyectos](/Images/proyectos.JPG)

In this section you will be able to find all the projects I've realized along this course. The first one is this Portfolio! :)


## Contact
![Screen Contacto](/Images/contacto.JPG)

In this section you will find all my social media and other ways to contact me. There is also a form (although it's just a sample and it doesn't work). Styling the form was one of the most challenging things I had to do in this project :sweat_smile: but I loved the result!

## Footer
![Screen Footer](/Images/footer.JPG)

In the footer you can find another menu leading to the different sections of the page and small buttons for my social media. My favourite section of my whole Portfolio is the "Hecho con â™¥", because it :sparkles: shines! :sparkles:

At last, these are the resources I used for this project:
* **Ilustrations**: https://undraw.co/illustrations
* **Habilitie's section Icons**: https://devicon.dev/
* **Social Media Icons**: https://fontawesome.com/
* **Emojis**: https://getemoji.com/
* **Fonts**: https://fonts.google.com/

Well, that's all! This has been a challenging project, but as It is my very first web page, I'm very proud of it! Hope you liked it too. Thank you very much!
